# Vigil 

Vigil is a community built AI-Native Security Operations Center built on three pillars: **Agents** for performing specific capabilities, **Workflows** for orchestrated multi-agent workflows, and **Integrations** for data integestion, tools and integrations to other open source projects.  Actually the most important pillar is **YOU** - this is your project, please contribute via feedback, code, a repo star, memes on Discord or otherwise.

## 12 Specialized AI Agents

Every agent has access to 19 backend tools via Agent SDK and 100+ additional tools via MCP. Agents are the building blocks that Workflows orchestrate.

| Agent | Role | Thinking | Key Capability |
|-------|------|----------|----------------|
| **Triage** | Rapid alert assessment | Fast | Severity scoring, false-positive filtering, escalation decisions |
| **Investigator** | Root cause analysis | Deep | Evidence collection, timeline reconstruction, cross-source correlation |
| **Threat Hunter** | Proactive hunting | Deep | Hypothesis-driven anomaly detection, pattern intelligence from 7,200+ rules |
| **Correlator** | Multi-signal linking | Deep | Campaign identification, attack chain reconstruction, entity mapping |
| **Responder** | Containment actions | Fast | NIST IR containment, blast radius assessment, confidence-scored approval requests |
| **Reporter** | Documentation | Balanced | Executive summaries, technical reports, audience-tailored content |
| **MITRE Analyst** | ATT&CK mapping | Deep | Technique identification, coverage analysis, gap prioritization, detection templates |
| **Forensics** | Digital forensics | Deep | Artifact analysis, chain of custody, multi-domain examination |
| **Threat Intel** | IOC enrichment | Deep | Actor attribution, campaign tracking, OSINT integration |
| **Compliance** | Regulatory checks | Balanced | NIST, ISO, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2 assessment |
| **Malware Analyst** | Malware examination | Deep | Static/dynamic analysis, family classification, C2 identification |
| **Network Analyst** | Traffic analysis | Deep | Flow analysis, protocol anomalies, lateral movement detection |

## Workflows — One-Click Multi-Agent Workflows

Workflows are the operational core of Vigil. Each worfklow chains multiple specialized AI agents into an end-to-end playbook that executes with a single command. No manual hand-offs, no copy-pasting between tools — the agents coordinate automatically.  

| Workflow | Agents | What It Does |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Incident Response** | Triage → Investigator → Responder → Reporter | NIST IR framework: triage an alert, investigate root cause, contain the threat, produce an audit-ready report |
| **Full Investigation** | Investigator → MITRE Analyst → Correlator → Responder → Reporter | Deep-dive with ATT&CK mapping, cross-signal correlation, response planning, and comprehensive documentation |
| **Threat Hunt** | Threat Hunter → Network Analyst → Malware Analyst → Threat Intel → Reporter | Hypothesis-driven hunting across network, endpoint, and threat intel — with IOC enrichment and detection recommendations |
| **Forensic Analysis** | Forensics → Malware Analyst → Network Analyst → Reporter | Post-incident digital forensics with evidence preservation, chain-of-custody documentation suitable for legal proceedings |

**How it works:** Say `"Run incident response on finding f-20260215-abc123"` and the system sequences four agents — triage scores the alert, investigator digs into root cause, responder submits containment actions with confidence-based approval, and reporter generates the final documentation.

Workflows are defined as `WORKFLOW.md` files in the `workflows/` directory and are fully customizable. Create your own by defining the agent sequence, tools used, and phase-by-phase instructions.

## Integrations - 

Vigil uses the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) to connect agents to your existing tools. These MCP servers give every agent real-time access to your SIEM, EDR, threat intel, sandbox, ticketing, and communication platforms — all through a unified interface.

| Category | Integrations | Tools |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **SIEM** | Splunk, Elastic Security | NL→SPL/ES\|QL, search by IP/host/user, detection rule CRUD, exception lists, rule preview, Entity Analytics risk scores, asset criticality, closed-loop alert lifecycle, auto Kibana case linking, Agent Builder (custom tools & agents), Kibana deep links |
| **EDR / XDR** | CrowdStrike, Elastic Defend | Host isolation/release, kill process, retrieve file, action status, Osquery live queries, alert lookup, host status |
| **Threat Intel** | VirusTotal, Shodan, AlienVault OTX, MISP | Hash/IP/domain/URL reputation, host recon, pulse matching, IOC search |
| **Sandbox** | Hybrid Analysis, Joe Sandbox, ANY.RUN | File submission, report retrieval, IOC extraction |
| **Timeline** | Timesketch | Forensic timeline analysis, evidence export |
| **Detection Engineering** | Security-Detections-MCP | 7,200+ rules (Sigma, Splunk, Elastic, KQL), 71 tools, coverage analysis, gap identification |
| **Ticketing** | Jira | Issue creation, updates, search |
| **Communication** | Slack | Alerts, channel creation, file uploads |
| **Data Pipeline** | Cribl Stream | Log normalization, noise filtering, multi-destination routing |
| **Core** | DeepTempo Findings, Approval, ATT&CK Layer, Tempo Flow | Built-in SOC operations |

**Coming soon:** AWS Security Hub, GCP Security, Okta, Microsoft Defender, SentinelOne, Carbon Black, PagerDuty.

MCP servers live in `mcp-servers/` and are configured via the Settings UI or `mcp-config.json`. Add a new integration by dropping an MCP server into the `tools/` directory — or use the built-in Custom Integration Builder to generate one from API docs.  If you build an integration that you find useful, chances are someone else will as well.  Please contribute!

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil.git
cd vigil
./start_web.sh
```

> **Note:** Docker must be running before you start. The startup script handles everything else: creates the Python virtual environment, installs dependencies, starts PostgreSQL, initializes the database with a default admin user, installs frontend packages, and launches both backend and frontend servers.

Auth bypass is enabled by default (`DEV_MODE=true`) for quick development. Full auth is WIP and while it will turn on it is untested. To activate auth set `DEV_MODE=false`.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Node.js 18+** (for frontend)
- **Docker Desktop** (must be running — used for PostgreSQL)
- **Git** (with submodule support)
- Claude API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) *(optional for initial testing)*

### Default Login Credentials

| | |
|---|---|
| **Username** | `admin` |
| **Password** | `admin123` |

> Change these in production!

### Manual Install

<details>
<summary>Click to expand manual setup steps</summary>

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil.git

## Additional Features 

- **SOC Daemon** — Autonomous 24/7 monitoring service that polls multiple sources (Elastic, Splunk, CrowdStrike, webhooks), runs AI-powered triage with risk-aware scoring (Entity Analytics, asset criticality), closes or escalates alerts automatically, creates linked Kibana cases for escalated findings, and exports Prometheus metrics. Run headless with `python daemon/main.py`.
- **Auto-Contributor** — Automated competitive research against proprietary AI security platforms. Analyzes a vendor's capabilities, maps gaps versus Vigil and the open-source ecosystem, and generates ready-to-file GitHub issues with acceptance criteria. The goal: make Vigil a superset of every proprietary AI SOC, one contribution at a time. See [`contrib/auto-contributor/`](contrib/README.md)
- **Chat-Driven Case Management** — Build cases through natural language. Say "add this to case XYZ" and the system handles findings, activities, timelines, and MITRE tagging. [Learn more](docs/CHAT_CASE_MANAGEMENT.md)
- **Detection Engineering** — 7,200+ detection rules (Sigma, Splunk, Elastic, KQL) with coverage analysis, gap identification, and AI-assisted template generation. [Learn more](docs/DETECTION_ENGINEERING.md)
- **Case Management** — Full lifecycle tracking with PDF reports
- **Approval Workflow** — Human-in-the-loop with confidence-based automation (auto-approve above 0.90, require review below 0.85)
- **Cross-Vendor Autonomous Response** — Multi-source alert correlation (Elastic + CrowdStrike + Splunk), confidence scoring, and vendor-aware isolation execution routed to the correct EDR API (Elastic Defend, CrowdStrike Falcon)
- **AI Enrichment** — Automatic threat analysis cached per finding
- **MITRE ATT&CK** — Technique mapping and Navigator layer visualization

## Example Usage

### Run a Workflow
```
You: "Run incident response on finding f-20260215-abc123"
Claude: [triage] Severity: Critical — confirmed C2 beaconing from HOST-42
        [investigate] Root cause: phishing email → macro execution → Cobalt Strike beacon
        [respond] Submitted host isolation (confidence 0.96 — auto-approved)
        [report] Incident report generated with MITRE ATT&CK layer
```

### Proactive Threat Hunt
```
You: "Hunt for C2 beaconing activity across all network findings"
Claude: [hunt] Hypothesis: periodic outbound connections to rare destinations
        [network] Found 3 hosts beaconing to 185.220.101.0/24 every 300s
        [malware] Cobalt Strike beacon — extracted 4 IOCs
        [intel] IP attributed to APT28 infrastructure (confidence 0.72)
        [report] Hunt report with 12 IOCs and 3 new detection recommendations
```

### Chat-Driven Case Building
```
You: "Add this to case-20260121-abc123 and note it's part of the kill chain"
Claude: ✓ Added finding to case
        ✓ Logged activity: Part of lateral movement kill chain
        ✓ Tagged with T1021.001 (RDP)

You: "Find similar findings and add them all to this case"
Claude: ✓ Found 3 similar findings via embedding search
        ✓ Added f-002, f-003, f-004 to case
        ✓ Updated timeline with lateral movement progression
```
